Project created for learning Python and Django, fun, study and job search

Although the site runs fine in my local environment, the site is no longer deployed, because I stopped paying AWS.

The reference I use after being away for awhile is [here](https://github.com/lizschley/number_six/blob/develop/scripts/documentation/update_process.md).

Feel free to use the code here: it has a standard [MIT License](https://github.com/lizschley/number_six/blob/develop/LICENSE).

The code keeps getting older and I do not intend to resurrect it.
