            "text": "<p>The symbolic and hard links you create from the linux <strong>ln utility</strong>, according to the bash manual, are a new directory entry (linked file) with the same modes as the original file.  To see the manual, type the following at your terminal's commandline: <pre><code> >>> ln man</code></pre> The two types of links are called hard links and symbolic links. Both types of links reference an |beg|Inode|end|</p> <p>Hard links are the default.</p><pre><code>>>> ln source_file [target_file]</code></pre><p>You can create any number of hard links, and thus any number of names and locations, can be created for any file. Hard links can also be created to other hard links. However, they cannot be created for directories, and they cannot cross filesystem boundaries or span across partitions.</p> <p>Soft or symbolic links are a special kind of file that points to another file, much like a shortcut.</p><pre><code>>>> ln -s source_file target_dir</pre></code><p>Unlike a hard link, a symbolic link does not contain the data in the target file. It simply points to another entry somewhere in the file system. This difference gives symbolic links certain qualities that hard links do not have, such as the ability to link to directories, or to files on remote computers networked through NFS.</p> <p>Also, when you delete a target file, symbolic links to that file become unusable, whereas hard links preserve the contents of the file. </p> </p><h5>Non-Web References</h5><p>Bash Manual from Terminal Commandline<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;BSD General Commands Manual<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;February 14, 2006</p>",
