They work on the Mac terminal. <p> <ol> <li>Alias: associated with the Macâ€™s finder app.  Along with the path and filename, the link is associated with a unique inode name, an identifier that will track the file even when it moves.</li> <li>Symbolic Link: like with an alias, a symbolic link is associated with path and filename, but it is not associated with the file itself.  That way you can have a different file with the same name and path, and the symbolic link will still work, assuming you were upgrading a version, for example, and you wanted the new file associated with the symlink.</li> <li>Hard Link: Like with an alias, a hard link is associated with the inode, so will still be attached to the file, even if it is moved.  Like with a symbolic link, hard links are part of the Unix operating system.  They are generally used when you want multiple links to the same file.</li></ol>"
