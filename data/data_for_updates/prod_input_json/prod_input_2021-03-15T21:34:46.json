In my Django settings, I have the following: <pre><code>AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {'CacheControl': 'max-age=86400',}</code></pre> This makes it so the maximum time the browser will cache the |beg|aws-simple-storage-service|end| object added through boto3 is for 24 hours (86,400 seconds). You can also set this in the AWS console.</li> <li>Setting cache behavior in Cloudfront. For the most part, I just took the defaults, which gives me 24 hour caching.</li> </ol> <p>Caching is wonderful when your files don't change, but right after I installed |beg|cloudfront|end|, I experienced its downside. My javascript changes did not show up and clearing my browser cache did nothing. So I renamed my file and all was ok. My thoughts were what a pain, but research showed me that this was one of the recommended solutions: |beg_ref|aws_cloudfront_latest_on20210111_updatingexistingobjects|end_ref|. </p> <p>Here are some choices and my plan in relation to the given choice:</p> <ol> <li>I need the same files in development and production, so I will rename the files as something else.</li> <li>Once the file is working to my satisfaction, I will deploy.  This will often mean deploying the code that calls it.</li><li>For SCSS files, compiling and compressing the SCSS, then moving the versioned CSS file to S3 will take a method.</li> <li>The goal is to automate everything, so it is both cheap and easy, but for now, it is better to understand the process thoroughly, so the automation will be makw sense and be as simple as possible</li> </ol><strong>Follow up:</strong> <br>Ended up creating a script to do the following (no changes to the actual caching): <ol><li>Compress the SCSS to CSS</li><li>Rename the css and/or js file by adding the epoch date (for versioning)</li><li>Leave the originally named files in the originals folder, in order to use git to easily track the changes</li><li>Update the html file with the new name</li><li>Upload all the newly versioned files, plus any new images to S3</li></ol>"
