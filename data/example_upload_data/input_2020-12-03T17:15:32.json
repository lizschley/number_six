I am using Catalina.</p>     <p>Tip: When running Mojave or higher (10.14+) you will also need to install the additional SDK headers:</p> <pre><code>>>> sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /</code></pre> <p>Trying to follow that advice, I got an invalid package path install error:</p><pre><code> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg</code></pre>    <p>Did some digging and discover that Catalina stores the headers in a different place.</p><pre><code>>>> xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path</code></pre><p>Resulting Path: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk</p><p>The underlying problem is that you need the C or C++ |beg|Makefile|end| to find the flags they need to organize the code for compiling and linking.   Mac seems to shift locations for these headers with every major release, so it is a big pain.  Pillow and Pyenv both rely on C programs that do not specify the correct location in Catalina.</p><p>The following links offer possible solutions: 1. |beg_ref_slug|bengtssonpeter_20200219_buildpyenvpythonversionsmacoscatalina1015|end_ref_slug|, 2. |beg_ref_slug|github_pyenv_issues_1348|end_ref_slug|, and 3. |beg_ref_slug|allanrob_20191127_installingpillowcatalina|end_ref_slug|</p><p>But my plan is to  try</p> <pre><code>>>> export CPATH=`xcrun --show-sdk-path`/usr/include</code></pre><p> and then restart my terminal.  This is from |beg_ref_slug|allanrob_20191127_installingpillowcatalina|end_ref_slug|. Hopefully Pyenv along with any other package that requires zlib or other standard headers will now install.</p>"
