        <p>This site is all about learning and sharing information. Although I have many ideas for the future, for now it is a portfolio and study aid.</p>
        <p>When I am an employed programmer, work always comes first.  Yet, I always imagine applications that I would create, if my priorities were different.  This site will eventually give me the platform to do that.  But in the here and now, my first goal is to create a site, allowing me to learn whatever I want, whenever I want, and to share the information with anyone interested. </p>

        <p>My Personal Requirements:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>No logins</li>
            <li>No typing https to get https and no www ever (it won't work)</li>
            <li>No extra buttons when a refresh or back button will work just as well.</li>
            <li>No data entry using forms</li>
            <li>Only a few static pages. Most pages will pull the data from the database, allowing the same information to be displayed on its own page, as a popup or as an answer to the a flashcard question</li>
            <li>Having a flexible format, so that different pages can be created by simply loading data with different categories and groups</li>
            <li>Easy and convenient to upload data and static files</li>
            <li>Excellent automated tests (the only requirement I have not met to my own satisfation)</li>
        </ol>
