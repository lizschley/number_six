Instead I add some extra neck exercises as illustrated in the Bob and Brad video below (Bob and Brad link below).</li><li>Do add lots of wrist and hand exercise variations, mostly because I have felt some arthritis in my fingers and have suffered from wrist pain in the past.  I open and close my hands while circling my wrists, move my wrist in all directions, touch my thumbs to the fingers in the same hand and anything else I can think of until my hand, wrist and forearms are tired.</li><li>Do a hip series, isolating the hips: side to side, front to back, circle right and circle left. Here is a link to circles done like I want to do.  After this, I do hip circles like Thomas Tapp does.</li><li>Do spend way more time on ankle mobility, in order to avoid foot and calf cramps.  I pretty much follow the GMB guide to ankle mobility (Jarlo Ilano link below).</p>"
