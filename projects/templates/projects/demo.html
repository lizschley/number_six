  <h3>Paragraph Display from JSON file</h3>
  <p>
    Display a list of paragraphs from JSON.  This particular JSON format is used to both load the database records that
    later can be used for paragraph display or to directly display paragraphs on this site.  This shows two things:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Gives insights into how this site loads the data, since the first step is creating a JSON file that can also be
      used as input for the display process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Illustrates that the display process is usable with different inputs.

          <p>
            This is the JSON file used before it is downloaded into a Python dictonary form.  The same file format is used to
            upload data from the database.  The next step will be to transform it into the exact format that can be used to
            display the information.
