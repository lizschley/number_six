    <p>To kill the process with pid==40676, you do this:</p>
    <pre>>> kill -9 40676</pre>
    <p>But if you know the port of a process, are not sure of the name and definitely don&apos;t know the id, then here&apos;s what to do:</p>
    <pre>>> lsof -i :8000</pre><p>Where lsof means list of open files.  The following is directly quoted from ss44: &quot;An open file can be a regular file, a directory, a block special file, a character, special file, an executing text reference, a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket.)&quot;</p><p>The -i is a way of specifying an internet address.  The colon says service or port.</p><pre>>> sudo lsof -i :8000</pre><p>The pid (40676 in this example) is displayed along with some other information</p><pre>>> kill -9 40676</pre><p>And it's done.</p>
