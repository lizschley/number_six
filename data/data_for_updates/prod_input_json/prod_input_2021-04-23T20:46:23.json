The more people share information and discuss difficulties, the stronger everyone's work becomes.</p><p>The primary key to a high quality product and a happy workforce is open communication. As a developer, I listen to the testers, customer support and the product team and always help anyone who would benefit from my expertise. When I finish my sprint work early, I pick up tickets that other people can't get to.  I communicate when my tickets are more complex than estimated, so everyone knows the possiblity that I may fall behind.  If someone helps me, I give them credit and stand up for people who I feel are being overlooked or underestimated. These little day by day things do not show up in a resume, but make the entire organization stronger.</p>"
