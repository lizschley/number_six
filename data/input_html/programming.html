      <ul class="c12 lst-kix_list_2-0 start">
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Set up a UI testing framework from scratch using Python, Pytest and Selenium.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c1">Created almost 100 tests in four months, ensuring the tests were both valuable to the business and followed object oriented and other best programming practices.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Eliminated login and navigation time by saving the login cookie and going directly to the page to be tested. Navigated to pages only when testing navigation.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Cached page data collected by screen scraping techniques, making it so the tests were comprehensive without the overhead of many page loads.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Used data-driven test development. This allowed test data and creation data to be changed in one place, and made it easy to reuse assertion methods.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="c9"><span class="c1 c5"></span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1 c0">Teachstone Training, LLC, Backend Developer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2013 &ndash; 2019</span></p>
      <ul class="c12 lst-kix_list_2-0">
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Implemented an end-point for uploading complex data to a relational database from an end-user supplied spreadsheet. The process updated or created records in at least seven different tables and validated against even more. In order to ensure integrity, created extensive rspec tests, making sure to validate all the business rules.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Implemented, as one of my first ruby projects, single sign-on according to the requirements of the PM. A few years later, the PM changed the requirements to be closer to my original recommendation. Played a major role in that implementation as well.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Incorporated Totara, an LMS based off of Moodle, into our existing processes by learning how to create and implement Moodle web services. This required mapping our data with information displayed on the Totara web page. Was successful, in spite of the fact that the Totara database fields that I needed to update were often named and fielded in non-intuitive ways.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Overhauled the trainer panel, turning a bug-laden application with inconsistent business rules into a serviceable application with consistent business rules. This was an interim solution, but workable enough to still be in place six years later. </span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Built cross-application monitoring for data syncs, using New Relic Insight custom fields, allowing us to measure the time from one in-house application to another through a third-party application for which we had no access. We created alerts and New Relic dashboards based on the resulting data. As a by-product, the information helped with bug analysis.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Worked with a first-time Product Manager [PM], Customer Support, course specialists and QA to flesh out requirements, write new Jira tickets and to update two separate back-end applications to improve the user experience in our video upload mobile application.</span></li>

      <ul class="c12 lst-kix_list_2-0">
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Played leadership role, working with the Quality Director, in designing the Engineering Project Management processes that involved MS Project schedules, feasibility and status reporting. Upon review, the new processes were implemented with almost no changes.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Led numerous projects both as a Product Manager and a Project Manager, working with developers, QA, Quality and the Release Team to meet requirements and release in a timely manner.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Learned MS Project and VBA independently, teaching the other engineering project managers enough MSP to get them over the initial learning curve. This enabled our engineering department to use MS Project in a consistent manner. </span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Automated status reports that read MS Project and produced Excel Reports with four months rolling history, allowing the engineering department to accurately and consistently report progress to the management team.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Wrote programs in PHP that parsed and analyzed text files for data conversion from Excel and Word to SQL Server, and to aid in DIACAP certification.</span></li>

      <ul class="c12 lst-kix_list_2-0">
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Developed and implemented a plan for table-based transformation in data conversion, taking on a leadership role in the project as a result of this initiative.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Instituted logging, log parsing and data analysis to systematically eliminate pre-existing inefficiencies and bugs in the site for which I was in charge.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">Led numerous projects as TL (also acted as developer and system architect). Delivered all releases on time, meeting the requirements with very few bugs. This success was largely because of communication with people playing the following roles: people managers, project manager, specification writers, programmers, test lead, testers and the various platform owners.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Initiated and led effort to fix problem caused by Windows Security Patch by upgrading MSXML. Implementation required research into IIS security and registry settings and negotiation for a new integration server and both technical and business resources.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Fixed highly inaccurate subscription data used by sales reps without disturbing the production process. This was particularly challenging because there were no matching keys and three fundamental problems with the original extract. Sent updates for over 50% of the records (a logistical problem) and rewrote the extract, so that sales reps had completely accurate information.</span></li>
         <li class="c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Re-designed subscriptions statistics storage and reporting. Reports went from obscurity to being widely distributed, used and emulated.</span></li>
         <li class="c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Developed on-line pricing form, using many different data sources, thus saving the company $10,560 per year by saving time for the editorial management team.</span></li>
