 Project created for learning Python and Django, fun, study and job search

 **This is a work in progress in the early stages**

Steps to test it out
* tested on Mac commandline, only

1. change directory to the common directory for development

`>> cd development`

2. Clone the code

`>> git clone git@github.com:lizschley/number_six.git`

3. Change into the base directory and create the virtual environment. There are many ways to do this, but this is what I did.

`>> cd development/number_six`

`>> virtualenv num_six_venv`

4 Activate the virtual environment

`>> source num_six_venv/bin/activate`

5. Install the requirements necessary

`>> pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. Run the server

`>> python manage.py runserver`

7. URL is localhost: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
