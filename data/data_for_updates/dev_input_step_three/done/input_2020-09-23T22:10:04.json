            "text": "<ul> <li><b>Leaves:</b> Seedlings have elliptic leaves with finely toothed margins; midveins are often tinged red.  As plants mature, the toothed leaves clasp to the stem. Leaf Description directly quoted from  <a href='https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/erechtites-hieraciifolius/' target='_blank'>NC Extension</a>. <li><b>Native Status:</b> Native to most of Eastern N America <li><b>Flowers:</b> cylindric, only 1/4 inch wide but about 3/4 inch long. The outside of the head has  1 to 2 series of erect phyllaries, equal in size, linear to lanceolate in shape, with fine darker green  vertical lines and purplish tinges. These usually number 21. From 1 to 6  yellow-green linear bractlets (calyculi)  may be at the base of the flowerhead. The flowers are disc florets of two types. There are no ray florets.  An outer band of florets are fertile and pistillate only. They have whitish to pale yellow corollas with 4 to 5  erect lobes. These surround a smaller group of disc florets that are mostly bisexual and fertile but sometimes  are simply staminate in function. These have corollas of similar color with 4 to 5 erect to spreading lobes.  The corollas of the disc florets seldom reach above the height of the green phyllaries of the flowerhead.  Styles are branched at the tip. The base of the flowerhead swells prior to flowering.  (Flower description directly quoted from  <a href='https://www.friendsofthewildflowergarden.org/pages/plants/burnweed.html'   target='_blank'>Friends with Wildflower Garden</a>.) <li><b>Distinguishing:</b> Weedy looking when it gets tall, seeds like dandilion.  Stems have ridges and sometimes hairs. <li><b>Size: 3-8 feet.</b>  <li><b>Wildlife Value:</b>  The flowers are pollinated primarily by wasps including paper wasps, hornets,  eumenine wasps, and spider wasps. Other insect visitors include long-tongued bees, short-tongued bees, and  Tachinid flies. The seeds are wind-dispersed and are used as a minor food source by birds. (directly quoted from <a href='https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/erechtites-hieraciifolius/'   target='_blank'>NC Extension</a>) <li><b>Growing Conditions:</b> It prefers man-made or disturbed habitats(roadsides, railway lines, ditches),  coastal areas, shores of lakes and rivers, meadows and fields, wetland margins.  </ul>"
