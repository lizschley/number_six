Project created for learning Python and Django, fun, study and job search

Although the site runs fine in my local environment, these links no longer work, because I stopped paying AWS: [website](https://lizschley.com/). There is some information about the site on [the demo page](https://lizschley.com/projects/demo).  

The reference I use after being away for awhile is [here](https://github.com/lizschley/number_six/blob/develop/scripts/documentation/update_process.md).

Feel free to use the code here: it has a standard [MIT License](https://github.com/lizschley/number_six/blob/develop/LICENSE).
